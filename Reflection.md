What I learned?
In this project, I learned how to use a few new pieces of P5 functionality that I had not yet explored such as-- mouseIsPressed for getting the points/clicking the circles, lerp color for the design aspect and making it look fun, translate for moving the text beside the mouse, and then the push and pop functions for separating certain lines from the translation. I also heavily focused on understanding loops and arrays which I needed in order to get the circles on the screen and have each function I was implementing apply to all of them. The loop would go through the array, doing whatever was indicated. 

Revisions?
Going back to this project I had to clean up some of the code and get rid of unnecessary lines or commented out items. But overall, I decided to leave this project mostly as is because I think it accomplished exactly what I was going for and met necessary requirements. I don't even really have any ideas for future possible changes to this particular project because I'm so content with how it turned out.  If I were to update it extensively I would probably just take this idea and make a new replit project.  

What I didn't know the 1st time?
I think I wasn't really considering the final look of my code and left a lot of lines that weren't doing anything or random comments that added nothing in terms of clarification because it didn't seem important to clear up. I now see that, looking back at old code, it is very helpful to remove unnecessary things otherwise I will spend too much time trying to figure out what they mean in the future.
